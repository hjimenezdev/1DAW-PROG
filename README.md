# 📚 Programing Course Repository - 1st Year Web Development

This is a repository to store all the exercises, projects, and exams I complete in my Java programming course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main folders:

- **Exercises:** This folder contains all the exercises I complete in the course. The exercises are organized into three subfolders: Sequential, Conditional, Loops, and OOP, depending on the topic they cover.

- **Projects:** This folder contains all the projects I complete in the course. Each project has its own folder within this main folder.

- **Exams:** This folder contains all the exams I complete in the course. Each exam has its own folder within this main folder.

## Folder Structure

### Exercises

- **Sequential:** This folder contains all the exercises that involve sequential structures, such as input/output, mathematical operations, and more.

- **Conditional:** This folder contains all the exercises that involve conditional structures, such as if, else, switch, and more.

- **Loops:** This folder contains all the exercises that involve loop structures, such as for, while, do-while, and more.
